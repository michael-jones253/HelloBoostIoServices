# Build a Docker image for boost cross compiled libraries and be able to retrieve them for deploying to a beagle
# This docker build also cross compiles openssl, however we do not need to retrieve them because they are statically
# linked for the beagle executable.

# First of all run the following to build the image
./build_image.sh

# Then to retrieve the boost libraries from a host mount run the following with a host mount point argument.
# NB docker container is sandboxed and only allowed to mount a directory under /c/Users on windows.
./run_container_mount.sh /c/Users/<host mount point>
